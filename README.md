# stock-prediction-using-ensemble-learners

Task : Increasing the accuracy of stok prediction by using ensemble learner. 

Ensemble Learner : A ML Model which use multiple ML model and calculate their individual result and combine them to give better accurate result.

Three ensemble learner are used bagging, boosting and stacking.
Decision tree is used as base learner and random forest for bagging. Desicion tree is used as base learner and adaboost is used for boosting. And for stacking, in level 1 KNN, SVM, Logistic and decision tree is used and in level 2 logistic regression is used.
